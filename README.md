## Installation

First go to the right directory: 

### `cd ant-design-event-page`

If you first time run it you need to install packages:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Requirements

1. **Setup:** Create a new React application using Ant Design Pro as the base framework. You can use `create-umi` or any other preferred method for setting up your project.
2. **Event Data:** Mock event data should be included in your project. Use any JSON structure of your choice for this data. Each event should have at least the following properties: `title`, `date`, `location`, `description`, and `image` (URL).
3. **Card Layout:** Implement a card-based layout to display events. Each event should be represented as a card. You are free to design the card layout as per your creativity but should use Ant Design components for structuring and styling.
4. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that your page is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
